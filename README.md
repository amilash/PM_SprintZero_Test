# PM_SprintZero_Framework
Sprint Zero Project setup exercise

# Project Approach
The Project Team will manage this project as an Agile Software Development Project. This means we will work in organized 2 week efforts called 'Sprints' to deliver the highest priority items on our Product Roadmap, as well to engage in frequent product prioritizatoin and team improvement activities. Sprint Zero (0) will be used to perform Project Discovery in collaboration with the Client Project Sponsors and Team, as well as to set up the infrastructure and accounts for the project delivery. After Sprint Zero the Raft Project Team will move into a regular sprint cadence to iteratively deliver the highest priorirty work on the Product Roadmap. For Sprints 1, 2, 3...x The team will engage in the following ceremonies on a per sprint basis: 
* Daily Standup- Daily Checkin on Team Progress and to unblock and impediments - 15-30m (Full Team)
* Product Backlog Grooming - Product Manager and Client Project Owner discuss upcoming work and prioritize - 1-2hr (Client PO, Raft PM)
* Sprint Demo - Demonstrate working code that is ready for delivery - ~1hr (Client Stakeholders, Raft Project Team)
* Sprint Retrospective - Meeting to assess teams approach, identify areas of improvement - ~1hr (Raft Project Team, Optional Client Project Sponsor/Owner)

# Sprint Zero (0) Agenda
Sprint Zero will consist of a 2 week Project Discovery phase whereby the Raft Project Team and Client Project Stakeholder Team will engage in discovery activities to identify and document the project goals, technical architecture, design approach, and align on next steps. 

## Week 1
Week one will focus on Product Discovery defining and aligning project goals. The following meetings will take place in order to accomplish these goals. Inbetween meetings and afterwards the Raft Project Team will synthesize inforamtion and engage in follow up research, and information gathering, as well as project set up.
1. Kickoff - Define and understand Project Goals, meet and greet team, discuss engagement approach.
2. Technical Discussion- Draft and review Technical Architecture. 
3. Design thinking workshop - Identify user needs and perform customer journey excersize.
4. Product Refinement - review initial User Stories list and begin to define roadmap priorities

Attendees desired for above meetings are the full Raft Project Team + Client Project Sponsor and Area Leads. Ideally the Client Product, Design, and technical project owners can attend all discovery activities. If not, area leads are required. 

## Week 2
Week 2 will focus on refining what we learned in Week 1, deepening our understanding, and folloing up on research items from the Design and Technical Architects. By the end of week 2 we should have a Project Plan, Product Goals Statement, Product Roadmap, Technical Architecture as well as an approach to Design and possibly some wireframes and low fidelity design documents. The Raft Technical contributers will use Week 2 of Sprint Zero to begin procurring access to any necessary systems, and setting up the technical project framework for delivery. The Design team will focus on wireframing and or low fidelity design deliverables.
Activities and deliverables can include:
* Set Up Project Repos
* Provision Account Access
* Product Roadmap - Deliver prioritized initial set up user stories and Product Goals Documentation
* Technical Architecture - Refine and Deliver V1 or 2, and agreed uplon technical stack/tools list
* Design Deliverable(s) - User Persona(s), User Journey Map, Low fidelity Wireframes, Content hierarchy if relevant, or other.
* Prioritized Roadmap - MVP definition and User Stories to begin work.
